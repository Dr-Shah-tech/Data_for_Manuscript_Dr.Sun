This repository contains the experimental  data supporting our research on the Wire-powder-arc additive manufacturing of alternating graded TiC and B4C particles reinforced aluminum matrix composite structures. 

These videos, taken by a high-speed camera (Acuteye V4.0, Rocketech Technology Co., Ltd., China), are showing the influence of varying powder-feeding rates (Vp) on arc morphology and droplet transfer during the WPA-AM process: (a) without powder (Video S1); (b) with Vp(TiC)=0.8 mm3/min (Video S2); (c) with Vp(TiC)=1.2 mm3/min (Video S3); (d) with Vp(TiC)=0.4 mm3/min and Vp(B4C)=0.8 mm3/min (Video S4); and (e) with Vp(B4C)=1.2 mm3/min (Video S5).
